	MVC: mapping and dispatching of client requests.
</p>

<p>
	The Iglu model-view-control package offers a mechanism to map requests to module methods in the application.
</p>

<p>
	Somehow, especially from a web environment (that was intended to contain documents instead
	of applications) it has always been difficult to interact with server-side applications.
	<br>
	The essence of a good system that facilitates the interaction of user interface
	and server-side application, is to keep the structure as compact as possible.
	Iglu MVC defines a minimal number of parts that need maintenance:
<ul>
	<li>A user interface part, typically a JSP that accesses
		the application via service components and agents and that has access to
		empty or (partially) filled out forms.
	</li>
	<li>A mapping part, a readable plain text file, that defines incoming requests,
		the module methods they access
		and the user interface part they get directed to depending on the outcome of the methods invoked.
	</li>
	<li>A controller part, being an agent or service component, that processes request data and returns clues to
		what to next.
	</li>
</ul>
In case of a web application, requests are collected and dispatched
by a servlet that implements RequestDispatcher. The DispatcherServlet
delegates requests to a web-independent RequestMapper,
which is configured as an Iglu component. The RequestMapper
manages one or more mapping structures that are based on a map configuration.
These structures may invoke methods on modules. After a process is finished
they delegate dispatching to the RequestDispatcher again.
In terms of the classical model-view-control principle:
<ul>
	<li>The model is (represented by) the service layer of the application in the form
		of services and stateful agents.
	</li>
	<li>The view is represented by JSP-files.</li>
	<li>The controller is the request mapper - possibly in combination with modules
		in the presentation layer - that decides, which business logic to invoke
		and which view to dispatch to.
	</li>
</ul>
